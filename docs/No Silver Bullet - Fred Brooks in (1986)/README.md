# No Silver Bullet â€”Essence and Accident in Software Engineering

> There is no single development, in either technology or management technique,
which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity,
in reliability, in simplicity.

## Abstract<sup>1</sup>
&nbsp;All software construction involves essential tasks,
the fashioning of the complex conceptual structures that composethe abstract software entity,
and accidental tasks, the representation of these abstract entities in programming languages
and the mapping of these onto machine languages within space and speed constraints.
Most of the big past gains in software productivity have come from removing artificial
barriers that have made the accidental tasks inordinately hard,
such as severe hardware constraints, awkward programming languages,
lack of machine time. How much of what software engineers now do is
still devoted to the accidental, as opposed to the essential?
Unless it is more than 9/10 of all effort, shrinking all the accidental activities
to zero time will not give an order of magnitude improvement.

&nbsp;Therefore it appears that the time has come to address
the essential parts of the software task,
those concerned with fashioning abstract conceptual structures of great complexity.
I suggest:
- Exploiting the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought.
- Using rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in establishing software requirements. 
- Growing software organically, adding more and more function to systems as they are run, used, and tested. 
- Identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of the rising generation. 


## Introduction
&nbsp; Of all the monsters who fill the nightmares of our folklore,
none terrify more than werewolves, because they transform unexpectedly
from the familiar into horrors. For these, we seek bullets of silver
than can magically lay them to rest.

&nbsp;The familiar software project has something of this character
(at least as seen by the non-technical manager),
usually innocent and straightforward,
but capable of becoming a monster of missed schedules, blown budgets,
and flawed products. So we hear desperate cries for a silver bullet,
something to make software costs drop as rapidly as computer hardware costs do.
